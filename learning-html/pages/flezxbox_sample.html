        <h2>First Article</h2>
        <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of
          the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting
          your mood.</p>

        <h2>Second Article</h2>
        <p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber,
          vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories
          of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.</p>

        <h2>Third Article</h2>
        <p>Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be perfect,
          you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at
          once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.</p>
