          <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself
            of
            the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and
            boosting
            your mood.</p>

          <h2>Second Article</h2>
          <p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates,
            fiber,
            vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain
            categories
            of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.</p>

          <h2>Third Article</h2>
          <p>Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be perfect,
            you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at
            once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.</p>
